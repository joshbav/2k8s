#### THIS IS A MESSY WORK IN PROGRESS, I INTEND TO CLEAN IT UP


# TODO: configmap, ref: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/22368
# show example use, but mention that they aren't as useful as people assume, 
# and modifying the deployment's env vars seems to be more popular


# yaml can be very unforgiving, here's a good online validator to use:  
#   http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
#   but it does not like multiple yaml docs, so cut each doc at the --- line before submitting
#   leave the default output of json, since kubernetes converts yaml to json internally
# also consider kubectrl -f <file or url> --dry-run
